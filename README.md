TEI XML files of the project [The School of Salamanca](https://salamanca.school/). Works, Dictionary Articles and more.

## What's this?

The project [The School of Salamanca](https://salamanca.school/) of the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz, in
collaboration with the
[Institute for Philosophy of the Goethe University Frankfurt](http://www.philosophie.uni-frankfurt.de/) and the
[Max Planck Institute for European Legal History](https://www.rg.mpg.de/), establishes a digital collection of sources
and a dictionary of the juridical-political language of the eponymous school. If you want to learn more about the
School of Salamanca and its role in the history of political and juridical thought, you can find more information on
the project's [website](https://salamanca.school/), but of course you may also prefer to start with scholarly reference
works, such as the respective entries in the
[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-salamanca/) or the
[Encyclopedia of Renaissance Philosophy](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-02848-4_692-1).
Of course, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Salamanca) has entries in several languages, too.

These files represent historical works of authors of the school or modern dictionary articles about salient topics
of the (Western) juridical-political language as it has been shaped by the school. They have passed several stages
of editorial work and quality assurance. They have been evolving in a private repository and become available first
of all on the website of the project. But once they have arrived here, they are ready to be shared
and forwarded to a long-time archival site and research data repository at [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/). This
forwarding happens automatically with every TEI file checked in here, and is done with the
[tei2zenodo service](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/rg-mpg-de/tei2zenodo) developed at the MPI for European Legal History.
